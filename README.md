```

Example:
```
https://ghl-oauth-production-abc123.up.railway.app/oauth/callback

## 🔐 Installing Your App

### Method 1: Direct Authorization Link

Visit this URL (replace with your values):

```
https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL.up.railway.app/authorize
```

This will redirect you to GHL to authorize the app.

### Method 2: GHL Marketplace (for Public Apps)

1. Go to your GHL sub-account
2. Settings → Integrations → Marketplace
3. Find and install your app

---

## 📡 API Endpoints

### Health Check
```
GET /
```
Returns service status and configuration info.

### Start OAuth Flow
```
GET /authorize
```
Redirects to GHL authorization page.

### OAuth Callback
```
GET /oauth/callback?code=xxx
```
GHL redirects here after authorization. Exchanges code for tokens.

### Get Access Token (for n8n)
```
GET /api/token?locationId=xxx&apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY
```
Returns the current access token. Auto-refreshes if expired.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJS...",
  "expiresAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "locationId": "abc123",
  "refreshed": false
}
```

### Force Token Refresh
```
POST /api/refresh?apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json

{"locationId": "abc123"}
```

### List Connected Locations
```
GET /api/locations?apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY
```
Returns all installed locations and their token status.

## 🔧 Connecting to n8n

### Option A: Use HTTP Request Node with Dynamic Token

Create a workflow that fetches the token before GHL API calls:

1. **HTTP Request Node** - Get Token:
   - URL: `https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL/api/token?locationId=YOUR_LOCATION_ID&apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY`
   - Method: GET

2. **HTTP Request Node** - Call GHL API:
   - URL: `https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/contacts/...`
   - Authentication: None (we'll add header manually)
   - Headers: 
     - `Authorization`: `Bearer {{ $json.accessToken }}`
     - `Version`: `2021-07-28`

### Option B: Update n8n Credential Manually

After installing your GHL app:

1. Visit: `https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL/api/token?locationId=YOUR_LOCATION&apiKey=YOUR_KEY`
2. Copy the `accessToken` value
3. In n8n → Credentials → Your GHL Credential
4. Update the Bearer token value

⚠️ **Note**: Tokens expire! Option A is recommended for production.

### Option C: Create a Pre-Request Workflow

Create a sub-workflow that all GHL workflows call first to get a fresh token.

---

## 🔄 Token Refresh

Tokens automatically refresh when:
- You call `/api/token` and the token expires within 5 minutes
- You manually call `/api/refresh`

GHL tokens typically expire in 24 hours.

---

## 🛡️ Security Notes

1. **Always use HTTPS** (Railway provides this automatically)
2. **Set a strong API_KEY** in environment variables
3. **Never expose your API_KEY** in client-side code
4. **Rotate API_KEY periodically** for production

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Invalid JWT" Error
- Token has expired
- Call `/api/refresh` or reinstall the app

### "Unauthorized" Error  
- Wrong or missing API key
- Check `X-Api-Key` header or `apiKey` query parameter

### "No tokens found"
- App not installed for that location
- Visit `/authorize` to install

### OAuth Callback Fails
- Check Redirect URI matches exactly in GHL app settings
- Ensure Railway URL is correct

### Token Refresh Fails
- Client credentials may have changed
- Reinstall the app via `/authorize`

## 🚀 Production Recommendations

1. **Add a Database**: Replace in-memory `tokenStore` with PostgreSQL or Redis
2. **Add Monitoring**: Connect to Railway's built-in metrics or add Sentry
3. **Add Rate Limiting**: Protect API endpoints from abuse
4. **Set Up Alerts**: Monitor for token refresh failures

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Railway logs for error messages
2. Verify GHL app credentials
3. Ensure redirect URI matches exactly
4. Test the `/` endpoint for configuration status
